Basics of html

<html>

</html>

In any html website - The content will always be present inside the html tags. The html tags will 
always be followed up by the <head> tag and inside this we will have the meta data and the link tag.
The link tag is responsible for importing the styling of the website. Followed by the title tage, it
is the text that is visible on the tab - Example in the current tab the title is "Editing BeautifulSoup
/Notes".

Now we come to the body tag, it is responsible for the contents of the website. <div> tags are used for
styling. <script> tags are used to import some javascript library.
